Claiming business expenses for a business with no income","Yes you can claim your business deductions if you are not making any income yet. But first you should decide what structure you want to have for your business. Either a Company structure or a Sole Trader or Partnership. Company Structure If you choose a Company Structure (which is more expensive to set up) you would claim your deductions but no income. So you would be making a loss, and continue making losses until your income from the business exceed your expenses. So these losses will remain inside the Company and can be carried forward to future income years when you are making profits to offset these profits. Refer to ATO - Company tax losses for more information. Sole Trader of Partnership Structure If you choose to be a Sole Trader or a Partnership and your business makes a loss you must check the non-commercial loss rules to see if you can offset the loss against your income from other sources, such as wages. In order to offset your business losses against your other income your business must  pass one of these tests: If you don't pass any of these tests, which being a start-up you most likely won't, you must carry forward your business losses until an income year in which you do pass one of the tests, then you can offset it against your other income. This is what differentiates a legitimate business from someone having a hobby, because unless you start making at least $20,000 in sales income (the easiest test to pass) you cannot use your business losses against your other income. Refer to ATO - Non-commercial losses for more information.","Claiming business expenses for a business with no income is a common practice for start-ups and small businesses that are just getting off the ground. It's perfectly legitimate from a tax perspective, as long as the expenses are necessary and directly related to the operation of the business.

In most jurisdictions, businesses may deduct a variety of expenses: such as rent, utilities, equipment, advertising, and salaries. These deductions can often lead to a business showing a net loss for the year.

It's important to keep in mind, however, that if a business continually reports losses with no income, tax authorities may classify it as a hobby rather than a legitimate business activity. This classification could limit the ability to deduct expenses.

Work with a knowledgeable tax professional to navigate these complexities. Make sure to carefully document all expenses and keep receipts in case of an audit. Overall, while claiming expenses for a business with no income can temporarily reduce your tax liability, the primary focus should be on generating income to ensure the long-term viability of the business."

Transferring money from One business checking to another business checking","""You should have separate files for each of the two businesses.  The business that transfers money out should """"write check"""" in its QB file.  The business that receives money should """"make deposit"""" in its QB file. (In QB you """"write check"""" even when you make the payment by some other means like ACH.)  Neither business should have the bank accounts of the other explicitly represented.   On each side, you will also need to classify the payment as having originated from / gone to some other account - To know what's correct there, we'd need to know why your transferring the money in the first place and how you otherwise have your books established.  I think that's probably beyond the scope of what's on-topic / feasible here. Money into your business from your personal account is probably owner's equity, unless you have something else going on.  For example, on the S Corp you should be paying yourself a salary.  If you overpay by accident, then you might write a check back to the company from your personal account to correct the mistake.  That's not equity - It's probably a """"negative expense"""" in some other account that tracks the salary payments.""","Transferring money from one business checking account to another is a common practice in the business world. This can be particularly beneficial if the two business entities are related or form part of a larger corporate structure. 

However, there is a range of factors to consider during such transactions:

1. Justification - While internal transfers can support cash flow management and corporate structuring, it's important to ensure the transfers have a sound economic rationale and are in line with overall business strategy.

2. Fees - Many banks charge for transferring money between accounts, especially when they're held at different banks. Businesses should factor these charges into their overall cost calculations.

3. Tax implications - Depending on the jurisdiction, certain transfers could potentially have tax implications and need to adhere to tax law and anti-avoidance rules.

4. Regulatory requirements - Certain industries or types of businesses are subject to regulatory requirements that might affect how and when they can transfer funds between accounts.

5. Documentation - Keeping proper records of all transactions, including money transfers, is critical for transparency, tax filing, and potential auditing purposes.

Remember, it's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or accountant to understand all of the implications of fund transfers between business checking accounts."

Having a separate bank account for business/investing, but not a “business account?”","""Having a separate checking account for the business makes sense. It simplifies documenting your income/expenses. You can """"explain"""" every dollar entering and exiting the account without having to remember that some of them were for non-business items. My credit union allowed me to have a 2nd checking account and allowed me to put whatever I wanted as the name on the check. I think this looked a little better than having my name on the check. I don't see the need for a separate checking account for investing. The money can be kept in a separate savings account that has no fees, and can even earn a little interest. Unless you are doing a lot of investment transactions a month this has worked for me. I fund IRAs and 529 plans this way. We get paychecks 4-5 times a month, but send money to each of the funds once a month. You will need a business account if the number of transactions becomes large. If you deposit dozens of checks every time you go to the bank, the bank will want to move you to a business account.""","Maintaining a separate bank account for business/investing can offer a number of benefits even if it's not technically a “business account.” 

1. Easier Record Keeping: Separating personal transactions from business/investment transactions can simplify record keeping and make it easier to track income and expenses. This could be particularly helpful during tax season when precision is critical.

2. Professional Image: If you are conducting business transactions, having a separate account can project a more professional image to vendors, customers and potential investors. 

3. Legal Protection: Depending upon how your business/investment is structured legally, a separate account may provide some degree of legal protection in the event of a lawsuit, bankruptcy or other legal action against your personal assets.

However, there could be drawbacks as well. Depending upon the specific banking institution and type of account, there may be fees associated with maintaining a separate account. Also, in some cases, there may be legal and tax considerations that warrant specific ""business accounts.""

In conclusion, the decision should be based on individual circumstances and it might be wise to consult with a tax advisor, lawyer or financial consultant to understand the best approach."

Income tax exemptions for small business?","Yes, you should be able to deduct at least some of these expenses.  For expense incurred before you started the business: What Are Deductible Startup Costs? The IRS defines “startup costs” as deductible capital expenses that are used to pay for: 1) The cost of “investigating the creation or acquisition of an active trade or business.” This includes costs incurred for surveying markets, product analysis, labor supply, visiting potential business locations and similar expenditures. 2) The cost of getting a business ready to operate (before you open your doors or start generating income). These include employee training and wages, consultant fees, advertising, and travel costs associated with finding suppliers, distributors, and customers. These expenses can only be claimed if your research and preparation ends with the formation of a successful business. The IRS has more information on how to claim the expenses if you don’t go into business. https://www.sba.gov/blogs/startup-cost-tax-deductions-how-write-expense-starting-your-business Once your business is underway, you can deduct expenses, but the exact details depend on how you organized.  If you're a sole proprietor for tax purposes, then you'll deduct them on Schedule C of your Form 1040 on your personal tax.  If you are a partnership, C-Corp, or S-Corp, they will be accounted at the business level and either passed on to you on a Schedule K (partnership and S-Corp) or deducted directly by the company (C-Corp). In any case, you will need good records that justify your expenses as business related. It might be well worth at least an initial meeting with a CPA to make sure that you get started on the right foot.","Small businesses may be eligible for several income tax exemptions and deductions depending on their structure, the nature of their operations, and the jurisdiction they are in. Here are a few common examples:

1. Home Office Deduction: If you use part of your home for business, you may be able to deduct expenses for the business use of your home.

2. Business Expense Deduction: Expenses directly related to running the business are usually deductible. A few examples can include office supplies, marketing costs, business travel, or any professional services.

3. Deduction for Self-Employment Taxes: Self-employed individuals are responsible for paying the full amount of social security and Medicare taxes, but they may be eligible to deduct half of this amount.

4. Capital Expenses: Businesses can often write off the costs of assets that have a life of more than one year such as property, buildings, or equipment either as depreciation or Section 179 deduction. 

5. Health Care Tax Credit: Small business owners who provide healthcare to their employees may be eligible for a substantial tax credit.

6. Retirement Plan Contributions: If a business owner makes contributions to a retirement plan, these will be tax-deductible.

Remember, it can be quite complex to navigate the realm of tax exemptions and deductions. Each small business is different, and what works for one might not work for another. It's crucial to engage with a tax professional or adviser to guide your tax planning process effectively. Always ensure you have the necessary documentation to support any deductions claimed on your tax return."

Do I need a business credit card?","It can certainly help build a credit score, but remember that businesses gain credit differently from individuals.  Depending on the country, there isn't usually a national register of business credit ratings the way there is for individuals.  The credit record you'd be gaining is with your own bank only. Banks will usually base your business credit record on revenue and transactional loads rather than merely on having and holding a credit card.  That said, it isn't always that easy to get a business credit card and so it is a useful thing to have for credibility with clients (depending on the type of work you do). A credit card can also sometimes work out cheaper (and faster) for financing small overdrafts than a regular business overdraft facility.  That said, I've found that larger loans over a five-year term can work out much cheaper for an established business than they would for an individual, even where the business itself has no history of using credit.","Whether you need a business credit card can depend on your specific situation and needs. If you own a small business, a business credit card can be beneficial for several reasons.

1) Separate Business and Personal Expenses: This makes it easier when it comes to tax preparation, as you'll quickly identify business expenses.

2) Build Business Credit: Regular use and prompt repayment can assist in building your business' credit history. This can be useful if you plan to apply for business loans in the future.

3) Rewards and Perks: Many business credit cards offer rewards programs, such as cash back or travel rewards, which can benefit your business.

4) Cash Flow Management: You can use your credit card to manage your cash flow, covering expenses when you're waiting on invoice payments.

However, it’s also important to consider the potential risks like high interest rates and the tendency to overspend. Before deciding, carefully consider the benefits versus the potential drawbacks in relation to your business' specific needs. If you're still unsure, it might be a good idea to discuss your situation with a financial advisor."

Personal credit card for business expenses","Early on, one might not be able to get credit for their business. For convenience, and the card perks, it makes sense to use the personal card. But for sake of a clean paper trail, I'd choose 1 card and use it exclusively, 100% for the business. Not one card here, one card there.","Using a personal credit card for business expenses may seem like an easy solution, especially for a small business or a startup. However, as a financial expert, I would advise against it for several reasons. Firstly, it can complicate your bookkeeping as it's not an optimal way to track business expenses separately from personal expenses. This could be problematic come tax season when trying to claim deductions. 

Secondly, if you are a limited company and you use your personal card for business expenses, you may blur the separation between your personal and business finances. If the business runs into financial trouble, you could be held personally liable for its debts.

Finally, there are plenty of business credit cards available with perks specifically designed for businesses, such as discounts at office supply stores, opportunities to build business credit, and the ability to issue multiple cards to employees. Using a personal credit card would prevent you from leveraging such benefits. 

Therefore, I recommend obtaining a separate business credit card for your business expenses."

Borrow money to invest in a business venture with equity?","It's clearly a risk, but is it any different than investing in your own business? Yes, it is different.  If you own a business, you determine the path of the business.  You determine how much risk the business takes.  You can put in extra effort to try to make the business work.  You can choose to liquidate to preserve your capital.   If you invest without ownership, perhaps the founder retains a 50% plus one share stake, then whomever controls the business controls all those things.  So you have all the risks of owning the business (in terms of things going wrong) without the control to make things go right.  This makes investing in someone else's business inherently riskier.   Another problem that can occur is that you could find out that the business is fraudulent.  Or the business can become fraudulent.  Neither of those are risks if you are the business owner.  You won't defraud yourself.   Angel investing, that is to say investing in someone else's startup, is inherently risky.  This is why it is difficult to find investors, even though some startups go on to become fabulously wealthy (Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc.).  Most startups fail.  They offer the possibility of great returns because it's really hard to determine which ones will fail and which will succeed.  Otherwise the business would just take out the same loan that Jane's getting, and leave Jane out of it.","As a financial expert, I would say that borrowing money to invest in a business venture or for acquiring equity should be approached carefully due to the inherent risks involved. 

On the positive side, if the business does well, the returns can be substantial. It allows for the leveraging of other people's money for potential gain and increases your capital base, thereby possibly increasing your return on investment.

However, on the downside, if the business fails or doesn't perform as expected, you would still be obligated to repay the loan, leading to potential financial distress. Besides, borrowing also implies an added cost of interest which could eat into your profits.

In addition, using debt increases the leverage of your business, which in turn increases the financial risk. High levels of debt could also negatively affect your credit score, making future borrowing more expensive or difficult.

Seeking the advice of a financial advisor might be beneficial before making such a decision. They could help you analyze the potential risks and returns, explore various funding options, and could better advise on the structuring of such a deal.

It's also important to consider other fundraising options like issuing shares, reinvesting profits, or bringing in other partners. These may dilute ownership, but they don't have the same risks as debt. Overall, the decision to borrow should be based on your risk tolerance, timelines, the specific business venture, and market conditions."

What's “wrong” with taking money from your own business?","""I'm no expert on this, but I would say that, if you own the business entirely yourself, there is nothing terribly wrong with using it for your own purposes as you would any other asset that you own.  What is wrong is not keeping accurate records that distinguish between your money and the business's.  As you say, this is wrong strategically, but it can also be dangerous legally, because if you mix your money and the business's money and don't keep track, you could find, for instance, that you've failed to pay the taxes you were supposed to. There is also a concern that might not fall under what people refer to as """"ethics"""" but more """"good corporate citizenship"""".  Basically, people tend not to like companies that just shovel all their gains into the owners' pockets.  This is especially true if there are ways the money could be used to improve the business.  In other words, if you're able to live high on the hog with the profits while paying all your employees a pittance, the public may not look favorably on your business.""","Taking money from your own business isn't necessarily ""wrong"" if you're doing so in the form of a salary or stipend for your role in the business. However, if you're continually siphoning money out of the business for personal use other than the salary, it can lead to several issues including:

1. Financial Health: Regularly taking too much money out for personal use can limit your business's ability to grow and reinvest in itself. It may run into cash flow problems, struggle to meet operating expenses, or have difficulty taking on larger projects.

2. Legal Issues: Depending on how you take money from your business, you could run into legal issues. If it's not documented properly or you're taking out more funds than you're allowed by law, you could face fines, penalties, and possibly legal action.

3. Tax Implications: Mismanaging how you take money out of your business can result in tax complications and even investigations by tax authorities.

4. Owner’s Equity: Consistent drawings could reduce the owner's equity which might affect the financial and growth potential of the business.

5. Devalues the Business: If you hope to sell your business in the future, excessive personal drawings can devalue your business as potential buyers usually look at the profitability of a company before purchasing it. 

6. Morale Issues: If the staff notices that the owner is continually taking money out of the company, it could lead to morale issues, especially if these actions result in cash flow problems that affect their salaries or bonuses. 

Therefore, as a business owner, it's important to strike a balance. Pay yourself a reasonable salary, but also remember the needs of your business."

Can Health-Releated Services be a Business Expense?","Chris, since you own your own company, nobody can stop you from charging your personal expenses to your business account. IRS is not a huge fan of mixing business and personal expenses and this practice might indicate to them that you are not treating your business seriously, and it should classify your business as a hobby. IRS defines deductible business expense as being both: ordinary AND necessary. Meditation is not an ordinary expense (other S-corps do not incur such expense.) It is not a necessary expense either. Therefore, you cannot deduct this expense. http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Deducting-Business-Expenses","Yes, under certain conditions health-related expenses can be considered a business expense. If you are self-employed, you may be able to deduct premiums that you pay for medical, dental and qualifying long-term care insurance coverage for yourself, your spouse and your dependents.

If the business entity is a corporation, the rules can be a bit more complex. In general, the corporation can deduct the cost of employee health care expenses as a business expense. If you are both the owner and an employee of the corporation, this can include your own health care costs.

However, it's recommended to always consult with a tax professional or refer to the IRS guidelines to understand the specific cases in which these health-related costs can be deductible business expenses, as there are special rules and limits applicable."

Can the IRS freeze a business Bank account?","If the business is legally separated and not commingled - they probably cannot. What they can do is put a lien on it (so that you cannot sell the business) and garnish your income. If the corporate veil is pierced (and its not that hard to have it pierced if you're not careful) - then they can treat it as if it is your personal asset. Verify this with a lawyer licensed in your state, I'm not a lawyer or a tax professional.","Yes, the IRS has the authority to freeze or levy a business bank account if the business owes back taxes and has failed to respond to previous notices or arrange a payment plan. This action is generally taken as a last resort after multiple attempts to resolve the tax issue. The IRS freeze prevents the business from accessing funds in the account. After a certain period, the bank is required to send the funds to the IRS to clear part or all of the tax debt. This can have a significant impact on business operations and it is advisable to seek professional tax advice or legal assistance to address tax issues promptly."
